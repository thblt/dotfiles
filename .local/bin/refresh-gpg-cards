# This script helps the gpg-ssh-agent and git work correctly with
# multiple sign and encryption subkeys stored on multiple smartcards.
# It reads the smartcard status and (re)creates ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol
# and ~/.config/git/signingkey with the keygrip of an A and an S
# subkey, respectively, present on a connected smartcard.
#
# This can probably be called from an udev rule, for each smartcard
# insertion/deletion.  It should fail cleanly if no card is connected.
#
# Notice that git doesn't read ~/.config/git/signingkey; this file
# needs to be Includeâ€™d from the main config, as follows:

# [Include]
#   path = "~/.config/git/signingkey"
#
# Limitations:
#  - Only works with a single smartcard.  This is a hard limitation in
#    git where you can only provide a single user.signingkey, but
#    there could be multiple keygrips in sshcontrol.  Supporting
#    multiple smartcards may also allow to prefer unlocked
#    smartcards/subkeys.
